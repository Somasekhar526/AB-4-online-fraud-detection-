1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset 
3. Data processing
	- Using Pandas Dataframe
4. Visualization using seaborn & matplotlib
	- Based on different Column Data
5. Label Processing
	- Label Encoder from object to int
6. Feature Selection 
- Lasso Feature Selection
	- Appending the Data to X_train and y_train
7. Data Splitting to train and test
8. Building the model
	- SVM - Quantum Mechanics
	- Bagging Classifier
	- LDA
	- LR
	- MLP
	- RF
	- Voting Classifier - RF + LR
	- KNN
	- Decision Tree
	- Stacking CLassifier

9. Training and Building the model 
10. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
11. Importing the packages
12. User gives input
13. The given input is preprocessed for prediction
14. Trained model is used for prediction
15. Final outcome is displayed through frontend

Extension
----------
In the base paper the author mentions to following models like different Machine Learning models, 98% of accuracy for RF
As extension we are going to apply DT and Stacking Classifier  for analysis the dataset, Stacking Classifier got 99%
Along with that we provide frontend for analysis and prediction of user input.
